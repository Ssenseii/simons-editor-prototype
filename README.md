# Simons Editor

written with typescript, this is an editor for simonslab's documentation. 
As I'm going for a static page, I created this tool to convert markdown into the appropritate html tags with the appropriate classes.

## How to use?

- write your markdown in the green space
- when finished, click "copy to clipboard"
- paste the code inside the appropriate div in the docs.jsx component in simonslab
